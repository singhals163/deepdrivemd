# CVAE Model Hyperparameters for KRAS (169 Residues)

# 1. INPUT SHAPE
# Format: [Channels, Height, Width]
# - Channels: Always 1 for a standard contact map.
# - Height/Width: The number of residues in your system.
# KRAS 4OBE has residues 1-169, so this must be 169.
input_shape: [1, 169, 169]

# 2. CONVOLUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE
# We increase the number of filters (vs BBA) because KRAS has more complex 
# features (alpha helices, beta sheets, switch regions) to detect.
# - Filters: Number of feature maps to learn at each layer.
# - Kernels: Size of the sliding window (3x3 is standard).
# - Strides: How the window moves (2 means downsample by half).
filters: [32, 32, 32, 32]
kernels: [3, 3, 3, 3]
strides: [1, 2, 2, 1]

# 3. LATENT SPACE (The "Compressed" Representation)
# This is the most important scientific parameter.
# It forces the AI to compress the motion into N dimensions.
# - BBA used 3.
# - KRAS is complex, so we use 10-12 to capture the subtle switch mechanisms.
latent_dim: 12

# 4. TRAINING SETTINGS
# H100s are fast, so we can afford a standard batch size and epoch count.
batch_size: 32
epochs: 100
optimizer: 'rmsprop'
loss: 'binary_crossentropy'  # Standard for contact maps (0 or 1)
